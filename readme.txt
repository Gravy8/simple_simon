This is a simple simon clone that I created using basic html, css, and javascript, implementing bootstrap for styling and
jquery for javascript ease of use.
I created the entire game in an object, and use an event listener to run the game from the object.
All of my functions were created to be as streamlined as possible, using as little code as possible to complete the task
they set out to acheive.
I use event listeners to look for user input, but only at appropriate times, and timeouts to control the way the game is animated.



Play the game by clicking start and then watching the displayed sequence. Once the sequence has finished, re-input the
sequence by clicking the correct boxes in order. Each time you complete a sequence, a new box will be added to the end and
 it will play again. See how high of a level you can get to.
